<h2>Internet Censorship</h2>

<blockquote>In China, internet access is strictly controlled by government. Some sites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.
	are not accessible. If we want to use them, we need to “climb the Great Fire Wall” by using Virtual Private Network (VPN). Below are some good VPN options that
	work well in China:</blockquote>
