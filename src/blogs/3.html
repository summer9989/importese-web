<h2>What Should You Know Before Placing An Order</h2>
<blockquote>Once you've found an ideal supplier, don't rush to place an order. There is a list of things that you should know about before giving
	money to them.</blockquote>
<h4>1. MOQ</h4>
<p>For new importers, and for buyers who don't know much about the market, it's better to buy MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) to minimize your risks.</p>
<p>
	If you find the supplier's MOQ is too high for you, <a href="Mailto:info@importese.com?Subject=More info&amp;amp;Body=I want to know about ...">contact us</a> to
	solve it for you.
</p>
<h4>2. DIMENSION &amp;amp; PACKING INFO</h4>
<p>
	In my previous article <a href="blog-single.html?id=4">(How to choose among sea shipment, courier and air freight)</a>, I mentioned that to reduce cost of
	shipment, we need to know the dimension of the product and its packing info, so that we can calculate and determine what carriage modes to use.
</p>
<h4>3. QUOTATION</h4>
<p>Needless to say, quotation directly decides your competitive advantages over other competitors in the market. With the same quality, the cheaper, the
	better. As a local Chinese team, we always get a quote at least 30% lower than that shown on Alibaba.</p>
<h4>4. QUALITY</h4>
<p>The only way to know about the quality is to see a sample. Never believe any pledges or promises of a supplier you've never seen before until you feel
	and test the sample in person.</p>
<h4>5. CAPACITY</h4>
<p>For a long-term business, you need to make monthly, quarterly and annually market plan. So you need to aware of the capacity of your suppliers to know
	whether they are flexible to adjust the production.</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, the complete process of importing is: <br /> Research market niche - source suppliers - ask MOQ - decide how many to buy - ask product
	dimension and packing info - determine carriage modes - ask quotes - adjust quantity - sampling - discuss and adjust samples - place an order
</p>
<p>However, it's not a fixed process. Use your own judgment to adjust under different circumstances.</p>
