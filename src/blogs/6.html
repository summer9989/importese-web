<h2>What Products to Buy For Private Label</h2>
<blockquote>Knowing what products to avoid, the next is to know what products are recommended to buy.</blockquote>

	It needs to be <strong>small and light</strong> – Trust me on this, you don't want to deal with the headaches that come with shipping furniture or kitchen
	appliances around the world. You want something that is going to be cheap to ship around, because shipping is going to eat your profit margins alive.
</p>
<p>
	It needs to be <strong>a simple item</strong> – What I mean by this is you want something that is simple to manufacture and has a relatively high margin of
	error. Most of these factories are not going to have the highest quality standards in the world, so the greater the margin of error you can put up with while
	keeping your customers happy the better.
</p>
<p>
	Keep it <strong>in the $10-200 range</strong> – In many clients' experience, it becomes very capital intensive and much riskier when they were selling items
	any higher than this. Higher ticket items are usually harder to ship, require higher quality control, and really magnify your mistakes when first starting out
	in importing. I have yet to find success outside of that price range, so I can't suggest you take any chances in it, but of course use your own judgment.
