<h2>What Products to Avoid for Private Label</h2>

<blockquote>Knowing what products to avoid can save you anywhere from $1,000 to $100,000. According to our years' of experience, you need to be
	very careful about the following products.</blockquote>

1. Branded products;
<br>
2. Cheap, Heavy &amp; oversize products
<br>
3. Seasonal products
<br>
4. Products already have numerous competitors
<br>
<br>

<p>Branded products are normally well protected by the brand owner with existing exclusive distribution agreements in place. It can be sometimes difficult
	to know if you are getting the genuine article until it is too late. They are always supported by strong legal departments and large resources for finding out
	those who have bypassed their distribution systems. What's more, warranties can be nonexistent or void if the product is not purchased through an authorized
	licensee. The last but not least, it is normally impossible to deal directly with the manufacturers of branded products (often the factories are owned by the
	brand owner).</p>

<p>Cheap, heavy &amp; oversize products are not feasible for shipment. On the one hand, the profit you make may not cover the cost of shipping. On the other
	hand, it is very likely to be damaged during shipment.</p>

<p>I am sure there is a bunch of money to be made in selling seasonal products, like Christmas stuff and winter clothes, but you are probably going to end
	up with a ton of worthless inventory.</p>

<p>Products already have numerous competitors -- Most of us buy electronics, clothes, food, socks and other essentials and think that they will sell good
	since everyone needs them. I can tell you right now that you are not going to compete in any of those markets. You really have to niche down in this.</p>

<p>Other than that, you are really free to explore whatever comes to mind. But remember!</p>

<p>Don't buy a lot of inventory in the beginning just in order to let suppliers give you a good quotation. Scale up slowly to keep inventory risk low &amp;
	retain cash for marketing/customer.</p>
