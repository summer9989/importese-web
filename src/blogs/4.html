<h2>How to Choose Among Sea Shipment, Courier and Air Freight</h2>

<blockquote>Even for experienced importers, it's sometimes difficult to decide whether to send their products by sea, air freight or courier. This
	article goes into the differences among them, looks at how to choose the most suitable channel and some strategies to reduce costs.</blockquote>

<h4>The Difference between Air Freight and Courier</h4>
<p>Courier, also known as “express” is a “door to door” service while air freight is an “Airport to Airport” service.</p>

<p>Specifically speaking, courier is responsible for all the processes, including local pick-up &amp;delivery, customs clearing at origin &amp; destination port,
	payment of taxes and duties, etc.</p>

<p>However, air freight only takes charge of delivering your goods from origin airport to destination airport. So, you need to find a forwarding agent to
	clear the goods &amp; arrange further delivery to your door. It would be better to specify in your trade terms with the supplier that who pays the forwarding agent
	at origin &amp; destination.</p>

<p>For example, if it's specified that you are buying FOB, your supplier need to clear the goods at origin port. Your nominated forwarding agent will do so
	at the destination port &amp; arrange for the goods to be sent to you from the airport.</p>

<h4>How to Choose among Them</h4>
<h5>When to send goods by air as opposed to sea?</h5>
Whether to send your goods by using an air cargo service or via sea shipping depends on three key factors, i.e. the volume of goods, weight of goods &amp; the value
of goods. Air freight is feasible in the following cases:
<ul>
	<li>● For sending samples.</li>
	<li>● For high value – low volume goods (that are not extremely heavy), e.g. Tablets, Watches, etc.</li>
	<li>● When your goods are time-sensitive or there is an urgent requirement.</li>
	<li>● When you want to keep your cash-conversion-cycle (CCC) short as compared to sea, air shipments tend to take much less time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the most common question that comes up at this point is, at what kind of volume does sending by sea become more feasible than sending by air? This
	depends on quite a few factors such as the “air freight” rate for the week (Changes weekly) &amp; actual weight of the goods.</p>
<p>However, I have found that once you cross the 1CBM mark you can start looking at LCL (Less Container Load ) sea shipping as an option.</p>

<h5>Air Freight &amp; Courier, which is better?</h5>
<p>To know which is better, we need to know how courier &amp; air cargo costs are calculated. When a courier services company, forwarding agent or supplier
	quotes you on per kg basis, they are actually quoting you on the basis of "chargeable weight", or Volumetric Weight (also known as “dimensional weight”), which
	is calculated by multiplying the dimensions of the carton and dividing it by the “dimensional factor”.</p>
<p>The calculation formula for calculating volumetric weight for “courier” shipments is different from “air freight” as the “dimensional factor” for courier
	is 5000, while that for “air freight” it is 6000.</p>
<p>This is where even experienced importers trip, when they are trying to decide between courier &amp; air freight, as they use the same weight to compare
	options.</p>
<p>
	So let's look at an example.<br> Product: Umbrellas<br> Qty: 1500 Pcs<br> Number of Cartons: 50 Cartons<br> Dimensions (Cm): 32*31*62<br>
	Actual total Weight of 30 Cartons: 22.5 Kg.<br> Volumetric Weight (Courier): ((32x31x62)/5000)*50 = 615Kg<br> Volumetric Weight (Air Freight):
	((32x31x62)/6000)*50 = 513Kg<br> In this case, courier charges would be based on 615kg &amp; air freight charges based on 513kg.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Let's say you were importing goods from China to the US, and were quoted $5/Kg for courier &amp; $4.5/Kg for air freight, your costs would be:<br> Door to
	Door courier: $5 x 615Kg = $3075<br> Air Freight = $4.5 x 513Kg = $2309<br>
</p>

Air freight is cheaper than courier！
<br>
But wait. Let's assume under both cases you have bought your goods on EXW (Ex-works, or Ex-factory price) Basis, in this case, using air-freight you would need
to pay for:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>● Haulage/domestic courier from factory to the airport</li>
	<li>● Customs clearance costs &amp; forwarder costs both in China &amp; USA</li>
	<li>● Haulage/domestic courier from the airport in US to your door</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Let's assume that as a ballpark figure these come to $300 in China &amp; $450 in US, so a total of $750. So now our options look like this:<br> Door to Door
	courier: $5 x 615Kg = $3075<br> Air Freight = $4.5 x513Kg = $2309 + $750 = $3058<br>
</p>

<p>So, the key question is, at what point does air freight become more economical than courier? From my years' of experience, I find that in most cases, at
	around 400-500Kg chargeable weight, the “total cost” of air freight is cheaper than using air courier.</p>

<p>For weight below the 500Kg mark, using air courier is also a simpler option than air freight, as you do not have to worry about dealing with forwarders
	etc. which means you can use that time to focus on other key areas of your business.</p>
