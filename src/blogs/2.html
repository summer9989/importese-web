<h2>How Much You Can Benefit From the World's Largest Tradeshow</h2>

<blockquote>With more than 4 million square feet of floor space, the Canton Fair is definitely the largest tradeshow in the world. Besides the
	scale, do you know why it attracts millions of entrepreneurs every year?</blockquote>

<h3>1. Best Price</h3>
<p>There are almost 60,000 suppliers attending the fair each time. Whatever you want to buy, you can find hundreds of suppliers at hand, forming a fierce
	competition for market. The obvious benefit is that you can get a very good price without bargaining. What's more, if you negotiate with them, you can get a
	much lower price. I usually save 30% for my clients.</p>

<h3>2. Quality Guaranteed</h3>
<p>Since it costs around $50,000 to have a booth at the fair, and the annual value of exports needs to reach at least $1,000,000, only the top suppliers are
	at the fair. This means you can easily find a supplier which has much export experience and reliable quality. If you still doubt about the quality of the
	supplier, you can ask them to bring samples to the fair so that you can check the quality in person. In fact, the best way is that you first ask all potential
	suppliers to bring samples to the fair, then you compare their quality and choose the most suitable one. PS. Some qualified suppliers may sell its booth to an
	unqualified company, which is usually a fraud. If you can't tell whether the supplier is a fraud, I'm always ready to help you.</p>

<h3>3. Instant Response</h3>
<p>It takes 1 day or even 1 week to get a response from a supplier on Alibaba, but on Canton Fair, you are welcome to go into any booth, and you will get an
	instant response. With half a day's time, you can talk to more than 5 suppliers, see their samples, and get their quotes.</p>

<h3>4. Good Relationship with Suppliers.</h3>
<p>I believe a good relationship is very important for business, especially in China. If you have a good relationship with suppliers, everything will
	change. You will enjoy lower price, better quality, value added service and much fewer troubles. If you need person who knows well about Chinese business
	etiquette, feel free to <a href="Mailto:info@importese.com?Subject=More info&amp;Body=I want to know about ...">contact me</a>.</p>
