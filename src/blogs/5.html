<h2>What You Should Do Before Asking For A Quote</h2>
<blockquote>Does it matter if i directly ask for a quote after finding a supplier?Before answering this question, I'd like to introduce what is FOB
	and EXW, which are two frequently used incoterms (International Commercial Terms) in China.</blockquote>

<h4>EXW - ExWorks</h4>
<p>This term represents the seller's minimum obligation, since he only has to place the goods at the disposal of the buyer. The buyer must carry out all
	tasks of export &amp;amp; import clearance. Carriage &amp;amp; insurance is to be arranged by the buyer.</p>
<h4>FOB - Free On Board</h4>
<p>This term means that the seller delivers when the goods pass the ship's rail at the named port of shipment. This means the buyer has to bear all costs
	&amp;amp; risks to the goods from that point. The seller must clear the goods for export. This term can only be used for sea transport.</p>
<p>Normally, a seller quotes on the basis of FOB, which contains import &amp;amp; export clearance fee and is obviously higher than that of EXW. But the case
	is, buyers, especially new buyers, find out that their orders are too small to use a full container later, and consolidate their goods with other buyers. In
	this case, they pay import &amp;amp; export clearance fee again.</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer to my question is: Yes! It matters if you directly ask for a quotation.</p>
<p>What you should do before asking price is asking the dimension of the products, deciding how many units you are going to purchase, then determine which
	channel of carriage to use. If your goods are small and light, and you think courier or air freight is a better option, or, if you want to use your own freight
	forwarder, you just need to let the seller to offer you an EXW price. Otherwise, a FOB price is acceptable.</p>
