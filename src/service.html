									<ol>
										<li>Study your sourcing requirement brief and create an appropriate sourcing strategy.</li>
										<li>Supplier Selection: We either select known and trusted suppliers or find new ones through local channels. (PS. Do you know that a gold
											supplier on Alibaba is just a bought membership? Do you know that there are many tactics for searching on China’s B2B websites?) We eliminate
											middlemen to reduce costs and more importantly the quality and customization limitations.</li>
										<li>Supplier Verification: Our verification procedures weed out fly-by-night companies and traders claiming to be manufacturers.</li>
										<li>Negotiation: As local Chinese, it’s not difficult for us to negotiate and reduce prices by 5% to 50% (If we don’t successfully help you to
											get a better quote, you don’t need to pay us for this part). What’s more, we can even negotiate to lower suppliers’ MOQ.</li>
										<li>Follow Up: Your project manager communicates with suppliers routinely to speed up your project, ensure packaging & deadlines, and save you
											from all pitfalls. After all, one bad shipment can quickly rob you of all your profits from 10-20 prior good shipments.</li>
										<li>Sample Consolidation: We consolidate samples from different suppliers into one central location and do a quick check for you so that
											problematic samples can be spotted early and sent back to the supplier. It can substantially reduce your “logistics costs” as well as “Bank Costs”
											since you send us a single payment as opposed to multiple international payments. In addition, this method can reduce “Fraud Risk” and “payment
											risks”.</li>
										<li>Mandarin Contracts: We sign contracts in Mandarin with factories on your behalf. This is one of our strongest quality control (QC) levers
											since English language contracts have no value in Chinese courts. These contracts include quality control & risk management clauses based on our
											years of experience dealing with manufacturers in China.</li>
										<li>Other Miscellaneous Services: We ensure that your goods are safely delivered to your destination and manage any issues that occur during the
											process. We usually do not charge for any contingencies unless third party expenses are incurred.</li>
									</ol>
									<strong>Why Importese:</strong>
									<ol>
										<li>Save you at least 90 days’ time. Time is money.</li>
										<li>Save you at least 20 % of the total cost through negotiating the quotation with suppliers.</li>
										<li>We do not just assist with your importing business. We see it as our duty to educate you so that you are able to maneuver the waters for your
											other projects.</li>
										<li>We are EXPERIENCED, and we are CHEAP, because we are a LOCAL Chinese company. If you find more cost-effective services anywhere else, we are
											glad to RETURN YOUR MONEY. <a href="Mailto:info@importese.com?Subject=More info&Body=I want to know about ...">Contact US</a> Let's start to import

									<p>Anyone looking to start business with China or people who have been doing business with China for years and are always on the look-out for new
										unique and interesting products, cannot afford to miss out the Canton Fair.</p>

									<p>Canton Fair, also known as the “China Import & Export Fair”, is the largest trade fair in the world, which has the largest assortment of
										products, the largest attendance, and the largest number of business deals made.</p>

									<h4>Facts and Figures:</h4>
									<strong>First Held:</strong> April 1957.<br> <strong>Interval:</strong> Three phases per session; two sessions per year.<br> <strong>Gross
										exhibition space:</strong> 1,125,000 m².<br> <strong>Number of booths:</strong> Over 60,000 standard stands.<br> <strong>Varieties:</strong> Over
									150,000.<br> <strong>Business turnover:</strong> 1.2 trillion USD (120th Session).<br> <strong>Number of visitors:</strong> About 200,000
									(120th Session).<br> <strong>Spring session:</strong> April 15–19 (Phase 1); April 23–27 (Phase 2); May 1–5 (Phase 3). (115th Session)<br> <strong>Autumn
										session:</strong> October 15–19 (Phase 1); October 23–27 (Phase 2); October 31- November 4 (Phase 3).<br>
									<h4>Industries:</h4>
									<strong>Phase 1:</strong> Electronics, household electrical appliances, machinery, lighting equipment, hardware and tools, vehicles and spare parts,
									building materials, chemical products.<br /> <strong>Phase 2:</strong> Consumer products, decorations goods, gifts.<br /> <strong>Phase 3:</strong>
									Textiles & garments, shoes, office supplies, cases & bags, recreation products, medicines, medical devices and health products<br />

									<p>Visiting China for the first time can be quite a challenge not just because of language barrier but also because of huge cultural difference and
										internet censorship. In China, some frequently used sites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. are not accessible.</p>

									<p>Therefore, we have especially designed the “Canton Fair Package” so that you can focus on the business and allow us to take care of the rest.</p>

									Our Canton Fair Package includes:<br>
									<ol>
										<li>Pick-Up at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport or Guanghzou East Railway Station</li>
										<li>Transfer to Hotel from the Airport or Train Station</li>
										<li>Hotel Arrangements</li>
										<li>Good Restaurants which are popular among NATIVES</li>
										<li>Transportation Arrangements</li>
										<li>Registration & Entry Card for the Canton Fair</li>
										<li>Personal Trade Assistant who helps you avoid the pitfalls, scams and frauds, and acts as your guide and translator.</li>
										<li>Help with arranging visits to tourist places and other cities</li>
										<li>Help with visiting the local wholesale markets & negotiating prices with suppliers</li>
										<li>Factory Visits around Guangdong Province. Factory visits to other parts of China can also be arranged however advanced notice is useful so
											all preparations can be made on time.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>PS. If you want to attend other popular trade fairs or visit wholesale markets and factories in China, we have designed China Visits Package for
										you. Contact us to let us provide a VIP service for you.</p>


									<h4>Why Importese:</h4>
									<ol>
										<li>We do not just assist with your importing business. We see it as our duty to educate you so that you are able to maneuver the waters for your
											other importing projects.</li>
										<li>We are EXPERIENCED. It will take you at least one week to visit the Canton Fair Complex which covers an area of 1,125,000 m², so an
											experienced guide who has attended the fair over 10 times is very necessary and can save you a lot of time. An experienced assistant can also help
											you avoid “fly-by-night” suppliers, trading companies claiming to be factories and other scams and frauds.</li>
										<li>We are CHEAP, because we are a LOCAL Chinese company.</li>
									</ol>
									If you find more cost-effective services anywhere else, we are glad to RETURN YOUR MONEY.

									Is the supplier a factory or a trading company?<br> Will the quality be as good as that of the sample?<br> Will all the details meet my
									requirements?<br> Will the quantity be the same as in purchase order?<br> Will my goods be properly loaded?<br> <br>

									<p>With so many frauds and deliveries of sub-standard goods, it’s easy and normal for us to have these questions if we have no physical
										communication with the supplier at all. Thus, to conduct an inspection is quite necessary to significantly reduce risks. After all, one bad shipment
										will swallow all the profits from your previous 10-20 good shipments.</p>
									<p>As a third party inspection company Importese only uses trained quality control inspectors who use the latest testing methodologies & our
										intensive inspection experience ensures that goods are exactly as per sample and/or contract terms before you make the final payment to your supplier.</p>
									<p>Some of the key inspection criteria include quantity, appearance of products, workmanship, production functions, colours, dimensions, weight,
										labeling & logos, packaging, and any other specific requirements as requested by client.</p>

									<h4>Our Inspection Services include:</h4>
									During Production Inspection<br> Pre-shipment Inspection<br> Loading Inspection<br> Factory Audit<br> Special Inspection Service
									based on your specific requirement<br>

									<h4>Why Importese</h4>
									<strong>Experience:</strong> Our experience of various industries as well as that of dealing with manufacturers adds further value to the process.<br>
									<strong>Safety:</strong> Our trained inspectors ensure strict standards applied to all inspections. You can also set your own acceptable quality
									tolerance levels (As agreed with your suppliers).<br> <strong>Client Involvement:</strong> All Inspection Checklists are sent to you for approval
									before inspection. Have facetime or take videos in the process if required.<br> <strong>Reporting:</strong> Get a detailed PDF report covering
									various aspects of the inspection, pictures & our recommendations, so that you can decide whether to accept or reject a shipment.<br> <strong>Sample
										Collection:</strong> We can collect sample’s on your behalf during the inspection lot & courier them out to you.<br> <strong>Reference Samples:</strong>
									We always encourage our clients to send a “reference sample” wherever possible, as it tells the inspector exactly what the product should look like and
									how it should function.<br> <strong>Speed:</strong> An inspection can be scheduled within 48 hours in most cases<br>
								</div>
								<div class="tab-pane fade " id="fast">
									It is important to use the correct shipping method in order to maximize profitability for your business. When transporting cargo internationally you
									need to decide upon a shipping method which will:<br>
									<ol>
										<li>Deliver cargo to the destination on time</li>
										<li>Optimize freight costs</li>
										<li>Be as simple as possible</li>
									</ol>

									Our Shipping Methods include:<br> <strong>LCL</strong> (Less than Container Load) refers to cargoes owned by different shippers, grouped in a
									single container by the forwarding agent, allowing transportation of smaller volumes of cargo without paying for a full container; this is more cost
									effective for smaller shipments which cannot utilize a full container.<br> <strong>FCL</strong> (Full Container Load) refers to a single container
									booked by a shipper to transport their cargo (exclusively). This service is commonly used by shippers who have enough cargo to fill the whole container
									making it cost effective to book an FCL shipment.<br>

									<h4>Why Importese:</h4>
									<ol>
										<li>We can help you save anywhere from $100 - $450 compared to the pricing you get locally in your country. Just <a
											href="Mailto:info@importese.com?Subject=More info&Body=I want to know about ...">drop us an email</a> with details of your Port of loading,
											destination, nature of goods and delivery dates, to see how our freight rates compare to your existing agents.
										</li>
										<li>We know which method is the most suitable for you. It not only saves your money, but also saves your time and frees you from all kinds of
											troubles.</li>
