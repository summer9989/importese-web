							<h4>About Jiang Jing (Elsa)</h4>
							<p>I'm Jiang Jing (Elsa), the founder of Importese, graduated from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, one of the Top 3 Universities in the
								field of English Translation and Interpretation in China.</p>

							<p>In the beginning, I was a trade assistant, which enabled me to travel throughout China visiting all kinds of factories and companies together with
								my clients. It presents a perfect opportunity to study the work flow of various industries, communicate with all kinds of suppliers and build relations
								with them. It also helps me gain a better understanding of my clients, most of whom are e-commerce sellers. They tell me stories and pitfalls they face
								during importing processes. Perhaps you also feel that it's difficult to source an ideal supplier, to place an order at a good price, to manage
								suppliers so that they can give priority to your order, and to make sure that the products' quality is good after you invest in so much energy and
								money. Maybe you also face issues like corruption, ethics, transparency, scams and fraud. You are not alone!</p>
